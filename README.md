# KinderLiteracyGame
 This is a solo-developed project made to gamify the teaching of literacy skills such as reading, spelling and character recognition to kindergarten-aged children.   Made using the Unity Engine, it contains 3 mini-games and uses programming patterns and practices such as object pooling, events and singletons.
